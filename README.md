# Django-Project
A small project to get to learn Django better

I created this project because I was curious about Django and really Python in general.  I recently picked up Python and have started working more and more with Django.  This project was the first thing I created.  It's an “About Me” app that is pretty easy to navigate through.  It utilizes MVC architecture and the “quotes” page dynamically displays data directly retrieved from the model.  This makes it easier to add the “daily quote” using the Django “admin” feature instead of reworking this specific view every time a quote is added.
